# ðŸ“˜ Project Portfolio: Hydrogen Production from Biomass  

## Project Context  
This project was conducted at the **University of Lorraine** as part of the DENSYS Masterâ€™s program. It assessed the potential of **biomass-based hydrogen production** as a clean alternative to fossil-fuel-derived hydrogen, which currently accounts for more than 98% of global production.  

---

## Objectives  
- Evaluate technical pathways for converting biomass into hydrogen.  
- Compare biomass-based hydrogen with conventional methods (SMR, electrolysis).  
- Assess environmental, economic, and scalability impacts.  
- Highlight innovative case studies like **HydGene Renewables**.  

---

## Key Processes Studied  
- **Thermochemical**: Gasification & Pyrolysis â†’ high yields, industrial potential, but cost and efficiency challenges.  
- **Biological**: Dark & Photo-Fermentation â†’ low cost and clean, but limited yield and scalability.  
- **Chemical/Electrochemical**: Photocatalytic reforming & biomass-assisted water splitting â†’ promising, but immature technologies.  

---

## Comparative Insights  
- **Biomass Gasification** achieved hydrogen yields of 40â€“190 g/kg feedstock, comparable to SMR, but with far lower emissions.  
- **SMR** remains cheapest but emits ~9 kg COâ‚‚ per kg Hâ‚‚.  
- **Electrolysis** offers high purity hydrogen with zero direct emissions, but is still cost-intensive due to electricity demand.  
- Biomass, especially with **carbon capture integration**, can become **carbon-negative** while addressing global waste management.  

---

## Case Study â€“ HydGene Renewables  
HydGene developed a **modular biocatalyst system** that converts biomass-derived sugars into hydrogen. The system is:  
- **Carbon-negative** (removes COâ‚‚ while producing Hâ‚‚).  
- **Modular & scalable** for rural and remote regions.  
- **Circular economy-aligned**, turning waste into clean fuel.  

---

## Key Findings & Impact  
- Biomass-based hydrogen balances **economic feasibility** with **environmental performance** better than SMR and electrolysis in many contexts.  
- It reduces waste streams (agriculture, forestry, municipal solid waste), while producing renewable hydrogen.  
- With policy support and technology improvements, biomass hydrogen can become a **mainstream feedstock by 2050**.  

---

## What I Learned  
- To analyze complex **techno-economic trade-offs** between cost, yield, and environmental impact.  
- To evaluate **emerging technologies** (gasification, fermentation, photocatalysis) for scalability.  
- To understand how **policy, industry, and technology integration** can accelerate decarbonization.

## Overall Impact  
This project reinforced the role of biomass hydrogen in building a **circular, net-zero energy economy**, with applications in industry, power generation, and transportation.
